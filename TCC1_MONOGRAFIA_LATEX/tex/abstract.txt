In this study, we aim to explore how artificial intelligence (AI) can be applied to assess the viability of relationships through dating apps, focusing on the capability to identify patterns that can predict and recommend partners with a higher likelihood of developing into stable and lasting relationships. The advancement of technology has enhanced the effectiveness of these platforms through improved personalization algorithms, which are essential for maintaining market competitiveness and are vital for many in their search for a partner. Although these platforms have achieved impressive commercial results, challenges such as accurately identifying compatibility and addressing algorithmic biases can still be improved. Given the complexity of the problem, it is necessary to develop solutions that address both general and personal trends simultaneously. This study emphasizes the relevance of the proposal for humanity by considering the efficient use of AI in analyzing behavioral patterns in dating platform interactions. Currently, the recommendation process focuses on user popularity and shared interests. This study attempts to add and emphasize psychological and behavioral variables to recommend matches that foster enduring relationships. Therefore, the proposed AI approach can enhance the match recommendation process for users of dating apps.
